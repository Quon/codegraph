/**
 * Server-level instructions emitted in the MCP `initialize` response.
 *
 * MCP clients (Claude Code, Cursor, opencode, LangChain, OpenAI Agent
 * SDK, …) surface this text in the agent's system prompt automatically,
 * giving the agent a high-level playbook for the codegraph toolset
 * before it sees individual tool descriptions.
 *
 * Goals when editing this:
 *   - Tool selection by intent (which tool for which question)
 *   - Common chains (refactor planning = X then Y)
 *   - Anti-patterns (don't grep when codegraph_search is faster)
 *
 * Keep it tight. The agent reads this every session — long instructions
 * burn tokens. Reference only tools that exist on `main`; gate any
 * conditional tools behind feature checks if/when they ship.

export declare const SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = "# Codegraph \u2014 code intelligence over an indexed knowledge graph\n\nCodegraph is a SQLite knowledge graph of every symbol, edge, and file\nin the workspace. Reads are sub-millisecond; the index lags writes by\nabout a second through the file watcher. Consult it BEFORE writing or\nediting code, not during.\n\n## Tool selection by intent\n\n- **\"What is the symbol named X?\"** \u2192 `codegraph_search`\n- **\"What's the deal with this task / feature / area?\"** \u2192 `codegraph_context` (PRIMARY \u2014 composes search + node + callers + callees in one call)\n- **\"What calls this?\"** \u2192 `codegraph_callers`\n- **\"What does this call?\"** \u2192 `codegraph_callees`\n- **\"What would changing this break?\"** \u2192 `codegraph_impact`\n- **\"Show me this symbol's source / signature / docstring.\"** \u2192 `codegraph_node`\n- **\"Survey an unfamiliar topic / pattern / module.\"** \u2192 `codegraph_explore` (heavier; deep dive)\n- **\"What's in directory X?\"** \u2192 `codegraph_files`\n- **\"Is the index ready / what's its size?\"** \u2192 `codegraph_status`\n\n## Common chains\n\n- **Onboarding**: `codegraph_context` first. If still unclear, `codegraph_explore` for breadth, then `codegraph_node` on specific symbols.\n- **Refactor planning**: `codegraph_search` \u2192 `codegraph_callers` \u2192 `codegraph_impact`. The blast-radius answer comes from impact, not from walking callers manually.\n- **Debugging a regression**: `codegraph_callers` of the suspected symbol; widen with `codegraph_impact` if an unexpected call appears.\n\n## Anti-patterns\n\n- **Don't grep first** when looking up a symbol by name \u2014 `codegraph_search` is faster and returns kind + location + signature.\n- **Don't chain `codegraph_search` + `codegraph_node`** when you just want context \u2014 `codegraph_context` is one round-trip.\n- **Don't use `codegraph_explore` for narrow questions** \u2014 it's a multi-call deep dive, expensive in tokens. Save it for genuine \"I'm new here\" surveys.\n- **Don't query the index immediately after editing a file** \u2014 the watcher needs ~500ms to debounce + sync. Wait for the next turn.\n\n## Limitations\n\n- Index lags file writes by ~1 second.\n- Cross-file resolution is best-effort name matching; ambiguous calls may return multiple candidates.\n- No live correctness validation \u2014 that's still the TypeScript compiler / test suite / linter's job. Codegraph supplements those with structural context they don't have.\n";
